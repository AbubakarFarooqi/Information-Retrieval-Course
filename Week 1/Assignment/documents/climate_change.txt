Title: Climate Change and its Impact

Climate change refers to long-term changes in global temperatures and weather patterns. These changes are primarily caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, the Earth is experiencing more extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms, and rising sea levels.

It is essential to address climate change through international cooperation and the adoption of sustainable energy sources. Immediate action is needed to mitigate the devastating impact on ecosystems and human societies.
